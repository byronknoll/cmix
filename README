Released by Byron Knoll on March 24, 2019.

cmix is a lossless data compression program aimed at optimizing compression ratio at the cost of high CPU/memory usage. cmix is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

cmix works in Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. At least 32GB of RAM is recommended to run cmix. Feel free to contact me at byron@byronknoll.com if you have any questions.

In Linux or OS X, use "make" to compile cmix using g++. In Windows, cmix can be compiled with MinGW (http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com).

cmix can only compress/decompress single files. To compress multiple files or directories, create an archive file using "tar" (or some similar tool).

For some files, preprocessing using "precomp" may improve compression: https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp

If you have g++-8 (or newer), compile with "-Ofast -march=native" for fastest performance. For g++-7 and earlier versions, compile just with "-Ofast" (without "march=native"). Compiling with "-Ofast" will have the fastest performance, but might lead to incompatibility between different computers (due to floating-point precision differences). Compile with "-O3" to fix compatibility issues.
