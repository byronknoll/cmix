Released by Byron Knoll on November 4, 2023.

cmix is a lossless data compression program aimed at optimizing compression ratio at the cost of high CPU/memory usage. cmix is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

cmix works in Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. At least 32GB of RAM is recommended to run cmix. Feel free to contact me at byron@byronknoll.com if you have any questions.

Use "make" to compile cmix. In Windows, cmix can be compiled with MinGW (http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com).

cmix can only compress/decompress single files. To compress multiple files or directories, create an archive file using "tar" (or some similar tool).

For some files, preprocessing using "precomp" may improve compression: https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp

Compile with "-Ofast -march=native" for fastest performance. These compiler options might lead to incompatibility between different computers due to floating-point precision differences. Compile with "-O3" to fix compatibility issues (at the cost of slower performance).

Instructions for enwik9 preprocessing:
1) Copy enwik9-preproc and dictionary/.new_article_order to a new folder.
2) Run: ./enwik9-preproc c path_to_enwik9
3) .ready4cmix is the preprocessed file. To reproduce enwik9, run: ./enwik9-preproc d .ready4cmix
